# SmallCodeChallenges
## A collection of small challenge codes from sources like Leet code or coding interviews.
The description of each problem is given at the top of the code (generally). The codes can be in Python, C++ or Matlab.

This is my collection of small coding challenges asked in coding interviews or from Leetcode that I find either interesting, fundamental or challenging or all of it.
